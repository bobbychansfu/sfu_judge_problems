    <h1>Grocery Run</h1>
    <p>
        Malcus, with his bistro's grand opening on the horizon, was in dire need of stocking up his pantry. The "Gourmand's Market" was his chosen battlefield, a place where the most discerning food lovers and the finest chefs went to arm themselves with the best ingredients. With a list as long as a summer day, Malcus knew he had to be strategic about his shopping spree.

        The market was a maze of delicious chaos, with vendors shouting the virtues of their wares and the air filled with the scents of fresh herbs and ripening fruit. Malcus, armed with his smartphone, had prepared a program to ensure he wouldn't be swept away by the market's frenzy. His list was his quest log, each item a treasure to be sought, and his program a trusty sidekick to keep track of his conquests.

        As he picked his way through the stalls, Malcus's excitement grew. Each found item meant he was one step closer to the dream of opening his bistro. But this was no ordinary shopping tripâ€”it was the hunt for the perfect opening night, each ingredient a star in its own right.

        Write a program to help Marcus with his shopping, the program should first prompt the user for an initial list, then delete from the list after each grocery item has been found.

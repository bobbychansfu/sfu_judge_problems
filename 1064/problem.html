    <h1>Cake Challenge</h1>
    <p>
        In a small town named Baker'sville,
        there's an annual event called "The Great Cake Baking Challenge."
        This event is open to all bakers in the town who want to showcase their baking skills.
        Each participant must bake a cake and present it to the judges.        
    </p>
    <p>
        You are tasked with writing a program to help automate registration for a cake baking contest. The contest has the following rules:
        <ul>
            <li>Cakes must have 3 layers</li>
            <li>The total height of the cake (sum of all 3 layers) must be at least 20 cm</li>
            <li>The diameter of each layer must be inclusive between 10 and 30 cm</li>
            <li>Cake flavor is not restricted</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        The program should:
        <li>Prompt the user to enter the height and diameter of each of the 3 layers</li>
        <li>Validate that the total height is at least 20 cm, then,</li>    
        <li>Validate that each diameter is between 10 and 30 cm</li>    
        <li>Allow the user to enter any cake flavor</li>  
        <li></li>
    </p>

    <p>
        Please write the program logic to register cake entries, validate the dimensions, and print if the cake is valid or not for the contest.
    </p>

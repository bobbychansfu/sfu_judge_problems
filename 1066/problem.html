    <h1>Pizza Time!</h1>
    <p>
        Bobby wants to order pizza for dinner but can't decide which option is the better deal. There are 2 pizza options available. Help Bobby determine which pizza has the lower price per square centimeter.
    </p>
    <p>
        The program should take as input:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Diameter and price of pizza 1
            </li>
            <li>
                Diameter and price of pizza 2
            </li>
        </ul>
        Then, output which pizza is the better buy based on the lower price per sq cm. Use the formula for area of a circle to calculate the area from the diameter.

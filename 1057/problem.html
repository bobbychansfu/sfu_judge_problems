    <h1>Repetitions</h1>
    <p>
        In the microscopic metropolis of Geneopolis, where the DNA strands twist and twirl like city streets, the annual "Festival of the Spirals" was the day when the longest single-character DNA sequence was celebrated. Ada, a young scientist, has asked you to create a program to output the number of the longest sequence of characters in a DNA strand.
    </p>
    <p>
        Given a DNA sequence: a string consisting of characters A, C, G, and T. Your task is to find the longest repetition in the sequence. This is a maximum-length substring containing only one type of character.    
   </p>

    <h2> Input</h2>

    <p>
        The only input line contains a string of $n$ characters.

    </p>

    <h2> Output</h2>

    <p>
        Print one integer: the length of the longest repetition.
    </p>

    <h2>Constraints</h2>

    <p>
        $1 \le n \le 10^6$
    </p>

        <ul>
            <li>If yes, then it outputs "Here's your coffee with cream"</li>
            <li>If no, then it outputs "Here's your coffee without cream"</li>
            <li>If the user inputs anything else, it should output "I don't understand what &lt;answer&gt; means" where &lt;answer&gt; is the customer's reply.</li>
        </ul>

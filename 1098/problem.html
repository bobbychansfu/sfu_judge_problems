    <h1>Matrix Cyclist</h1>
    <p>
        Imagine a cyclist riding within the confines of a square park, taking sharp 90-degree turns at each corner. With every turn, the cyclist's perspective of the park shifts, the world rotating around them. This is not a tale about cycling, though, but about matrices and perspectives!

    </p> 
    <p>
        Your task is to emulate this shift in perspective for a square matrix. Picture the matrix as an aerial view of a perfectly symmetrical park, and as you rotate the matrix, you mimic the cyclist taking those sharp, angular turns. But instead of a person, you are rotating rows and columns of numbers, and with each 90-degree turn, the landscape changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Write a rotate() function to manipulate this numerical world. Your function should be able to take in a 2d list matrix and return the same matrix after it has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise, just as the world turns anew for our cyclist at each corner.

    </p>
   <p>
    To complete this task, you can the provided sample code and write the <code>rotate(matrix)</code> function, where <code>matrix</code> is a 2d list. Do not change anything else in the code.  <br>
   </p>   

<code>rotate([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])</code> returns: <code>[[7, 4, 1], [8, 5, 2], [9, 6, 3]]</code> <br>

    <h1>Deciphering Quantum Numbers</h1>
    <p>
        Kevin, a programmer with a curious condition, sees numbers not as simple integers but as a blur of quantum possibilities, ever-shifting and impossible to pin down. This peculiar side-effect of an old quantum computing experiment gone awry has left him unable to discern one number's magnitude from another's. Today, Kevin faces a task that many would find elementary but for him is an insurmountable challenge: arranging numbers.
    </p> 
    <p>
        Kevin needs your help. He's attempting to tackle a problem that involves identifying the maximum among three numbers, a task his unique condition makes impossible. Thus, he's turning to you to create a solution in a world where numbers are steadfast and certain. Your goal is to write a function named <code>order()</code> that can take in the chaos of Kevin's quantum numbers — three integers — and return them as a tuple arranged in clear, increasing order.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The function should meet the following criteria:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Craft a function named <code>order()</code> that accepts three integers.</li>
        <li>The function must discern the classical value of these quantum-blurred numbers. </li>
        <li>Return a tuple with the three numbers, sorted in increasing order from smallest to largest.</li>

    </ul>    
To complete this task, you can the provided sample code and write the <code>order(a,b,c)</code> function. Do not change anything else in the code.  <br>
<code>order(23,4,42)</code> returns <code>(4,23,42)</code> <br>

</p>

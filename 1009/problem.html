    <h1>Magnificent Movie</h1>
    <p>
        After such a hard contest, Alice and Bob would like to sit down
        and watch a movie.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, their only screen is an $80 \times 24$
        Terminal window.
    </p>
    <h1>Task</h1>
    <p>
        Write a program without input that outputs a video, or cool animation,
        to said terminal window.
        There is no need to use TTY, ncurses, or anything like that.
        You can simply re-print the whole screen with every frame.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will receive 10 points for submitting this problem (and having it
        compile properly if needed), but at the end
        of the contest, <b>only your latest submission will be judged
            manually.
        </b>
        <br>
        You will be marked out of 100 points for video quality, artistry,
        and creativity.
        <br>
        The video can not take more than 30 seconds to complete, as the judges
        have only a certain amount of time.
        <br>
        If you have problems submitting or anything, please come ask the judges
        to view your video at your computer, and they will mark you from there.

    <h1>Cone Troubles</h1>
    <p>
        Bob is keeping very close tabs on his weight. Each time he eats ice cream, he must calculate the total volume of his ice cream cone, so he stays within his daily limit.  Write a program to help bob calculate the total volume of his ice cream cone.
        This formula gives the volume of a cone: $1/3 \pi r^2 h$ where $\pi$ is 3.14, $h$ is the height of the cone, and $r$ is the radius of the top circle. 

    </p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        Prompt the user to give the $r$ and $h$, values. 
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        A single floating point number rounded to 2 decimal places, the volume of Bob's cone.

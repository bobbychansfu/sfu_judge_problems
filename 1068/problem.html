    <h1>Password</h1>
    <p>
        Bobby has implemented a system where users are required to enter their username and password. The correct credentials are as follows:
	<ul>
        <li>Username: bobby</li>
        <li>Password: BEST54</li>
    </ul>
        
    Bobby wants to keep prompting users until they input the correct credentials. However, he also wants to ensure the security of the system by limiting the number of login attempts. If a user fails to enter the correct credentials within three attempts, the system should lock the user out.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your task is to write a program to implement this system.
    </p>
   
    <h3>
        Input
    </h3>

    <p>
        The user will input the username and password. The input will be two strings separated by a space, where the first string represents the username and the second string represents the password.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Output
    </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            If the user enters the correct credentials, print "Access Granted".
        </li>
        <li>
            If the user enters incorrect credentials, print "Incorrect credentials. You have X attempts left.", where X represents the number of attempts remaining.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the user fails three times, print "Account Locked."
        </li>

    </ul>

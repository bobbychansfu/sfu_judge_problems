    <h1>Calendar Constructor</h1>
    <p>
        Your task is to implement a function named <code>printCalendar(y,m)</code> that prints the calendar of a given month in a specific year. The calendar should display each week as a row, with seven spaces representing the days of the week, separated by a single space. Days should be represented by their corresponding number (1-31), and empty spaces in the calendar should remain blank.
The function will receive two integers as input:
        <ul>
            <li>
                $y$ ($1 \leq y \leq 9999$): a year
            </li>
            <li>
                $m$ ($1 \leq m \leq 12$): a month
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        You must consider leap years in your implementation. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or if it is divisible by 400. Specifically, February (month 2) has 29 days in a leap year and 28 days in other years.
Your function should not return any value but should print the calendar directly to the standard output.
    </p>
   
    <h3>Additional specifications:</h3>
    <p>
       <ul>
        <li>The first day of the week is considered Sunday.</li>
        <li>You need not print the days of the week (e.g., Sun, Mon, etc.); only the days as space-separated values.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the first day of each month aligns with the correct day of the week for that month/year combination.</li>
       </ul> 
    </p>

    <h3>
        Sample Run 1
    </h3>
    <p>
        To complete this task, you can download the provided sample code and write the <code>printCalendar(y,m)</code> function. Do not change anything else in the code.  <br>
<code>printCalendar(2024,2)</code> prints out: 
<pre>
             1  2  3 
 4  5  6  7  8  9 10 
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 
18 19 20 21 22 23 24 
25 26 27 28 29 
</pre>

<br>
    Explanation: <br>
    February in the year 2024 is a leap year, so it has 29 days. <br>
    The 1st of February, 2024, falls on a Thursday (this specific alignment should be calculated, it's not given).

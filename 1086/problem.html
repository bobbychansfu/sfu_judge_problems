    <h1>A Dull Password</h1>
    <p>
        Amy finally arrives at the 'P' door to the escape pod station! 
        She walks in, and as she catches her breath, she looks around. For whatever reason, there is another door in front of her.
        The door is massive with a keyboard on it, and five large squares lying above it.
        Typing on the keyboard, she sees the letters appear in the squares.
        She types in a word, and upon pressing enter, some of the squares light up with a soft yellow glow.
        Others light up with a bright green!
    </p>
    <p>
        She recognizes this game.
        The password to get to the escape pod is a five-letter word, and she can guess words to get hints.
        Each word that she guesses must be a valid five-letter word.
        After she has typed in the word and hit enter, she gains feedback.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A green light, denoted by a star <code>*</code>, indicates that the letter is correct and in the correct position.</li>
        <li>A yellow light, denoted by a dash <code>-</code>, indicates that the letter is in the correct word, but in another location.</li>
        <li>No light, denoted by an underscore <code>_</code> indicates that letter is not in the word.</li>
        <li>Note that a single letter can only trigger a single light.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
    <p>
        The list of available words will be made available to your program through the path <code>words.txt</code>.
        These are the first 2500 words of a famous list by Donald Knuth.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            This is an interactive problem.
        </b>
        This means that you have to be extra careful with whitespace and formatting.
        Output no extra newlines, and exit your code the moment you receive an "ERROR", or guess the last word.
        Furthermore, <b>Make sure to flush after your print statements</b>.
        This can be done through C++'s <code>endl</code>, and Python's <code>print</code> function flushes automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
        The judge will start off by sending two integers: the number of words you will be guessing, and your maximum total number of guesses over all words.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, you must print a guess: a five-letter lowercase English word (from <code>words.txt</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
        After you submit a correct guess, the judge will output <code>*****</code>,
        and if there are still words to guess, you will have to continue the game,
        starting guessing again for a new word.
        If you are done with all the words, exit immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you guess an invalid word, or run out of guesses,
        or anything else bad happens, the judge will print <code>ERROR</code>.
        If you ever receive this output, please terminate your program immediately
        so that your submission is marked as a Wrong Answer rather than some other error.
    </p>

    <h2>Testing</h2>
    <p>
        To test your program, run the supplied <code>run_interactive.py</code> program:
    </p>
    <pre>
        python3 run_interactive.py "python3 interactor.py sample2.in" "your program"
    </pre>
    <p>
        Make sure that <code>words.txt</code> and <code>sample.in</code> are in the same folder
        as the three other programs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that the problem has a time limit of 5 seconds per test!
        A result of <code>TLE</code> is not guaranteed if you use too much time (interactive judges are hard to make, blame Ari), so beware.
    </p>

        My computer used a hexadecimal system to represent decimal numbers. This is normally represented as a set of 16 digits 
        (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F) in base 16, where A = 10, B = 11, C = 12... F = 15. As an example, the hexadecimal string
        1C0 would be equal to 1*256 + 12*16 + 0 = 448 in decimal.
    </p>
    <p>    
        Unfortunately, my computer decided to do a funny (probably because I spilled mint chocolate chip ice cream on it) and rearrange all of the values of the digits. 
        More formally, a rearranging of the digits is definied as a bijective function $f$ from ${0,1,...,E,F}$ to ${0,1,...,E,F}$.
        Then under a rearrangement, the numerical value of a digit $i \in {0,1,...,E,F}$
        is equal to $f(i)$. Using the example above, suppose $f(1) = 0$, $f(C) = 1$, $f(0) = 2$,
        then the value of 1C0 when decoded would be f(1)*256 + f(12)*16 + f(0) = 0*256 + 1*16 + 2 = 18 in decimal.
        
        Thankfully, I do know some valid comparison statements under the 
        new digit labelling system, which may be enough information to determine
        what each digit was rearranged to, at least assuming that the set of
        comparisons are actually well-formed. Now the question is 
        to determine if I can tell what the decoded values of several hexadecimal strings 
        actually are.
    </p>

   
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        The first line contains integers $n (1 <= n <= 2000)$ and $q (1 <= q <= 1000)$.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following $n$ lines each contain a numerical comparison statement either in the form `a > b` or `a < b`, where a and b 
        are shuffled hexadecimal values. a and b will contain at most 15 digits, and are guaranteed to be the same length. 
        It is guaranteed that if a unique shuffling of the digits exists, every hexadecimal string represents an actual value. <b>
        Note that even if a string when decoded would result in a number with leading 0's (such as 007), it is still considered valid.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        The following $q$ lines will each contain an encoded hexadecimal value $x$. $x$ will contain at most 15 digits.
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        If there is a contradiction in the numerical comparisons, output `NO`. 

        Otherwise, output `YES` on the first line, and for the following $q$ lines, for each encoded value $x$, either:

        1. If there exists a unique value for which $x$ must be equal to when decoded, output that value.

        2. If $x$ could be decoded to multiple possible values, output `?`.
    </p>
 
 <h2>Scoring</h2>
 <p>
    Case 1 (4 points):

    The worries about the computer being corrupted are completely overblown and it turns out literally none of
    the digits have been shuffled. In a problem standpoint, this will be guaranteed by the first (and only) 15 comparisons
    being listed as follows:

 </p>    
 <p class="monospace">
    0 < 1
    1 < 2
    2 < 3
    3 < 4
    4 < 5
    5 < 6
    6 < 7
    7 < 8
    8 < 9
    9 < A
    A < B
    B < C
    C < D
    D < E
    E < F
    </p>

 <p>
    Case 2 (44 points, 48 total):
    
    Thankfully, you know (don't ask how) that the digits from 0-9 have not been shuffled, and that only 
    the digits A-F may have been shuffled. In a problem standpoint, the following 15 comparisons are guaranteed
    to appear in each testcase:

  </p>  

  <p class="monospace">
    0 < 1
    1 < 2
    2 < 3
    3 < 4
    4 < 5
    5 < 6
    6 < 7
    7 < 8
    8 < 9
    9 < A
    9 < B
    9 < C
    9 < D
    9 < E
    9 < F
    </p>

    <p>
        Case 3 (52 points, 100 total):
    
        There are NO restrictions on how the digits are encoded (asides from the assumption that if a valid encoding exists, no two digits have the same value).

    </p>

    <p>
        There are no contradictions in the comparisons, so `YES` is outputted. The following lines contain the decimal representations of the hexadecimal
        values 10, E, and 123.

    <h2>Sample 2</h2>
    <h3><code>stdin</code></h3>

    <h3><code>stdout</code></h3>
    <p class="monospace">
        NO    
    </p>
    <p>
    The comparisons claim that $f(7) < f(5)$, $f(5) < f(9)$, and $f(9) < f(7)$. However, $f(5), f(7), f(9)$ must all be unique values, so this
    must be a contradiction, thus `NO` is outputted. Note that no further output is needed for this test case.

    </p>

    <h2>Sample 3</h2>
    <h3><code>stdin</code></h3>
    <p class="monospace">
        15 2
        F < 0
    F < 1
    F < 2

    <p class="monospace">

        ?    
    </p>
    <p>
    There are no contradictions in the comparisons, thus `YES` is outputted first. From the comparisons, we can conclude that $f(F)$ must be the lowest possible value
    since all other digits have been assigned higher values, thus F must decode to 0. However, no further information can be obtained. 448 can be decoded into decimal
    as many possible values such as 82 $(f(4) = 1, f(8) = 2)$, 404 $(f(4) = 5, f(8) = 4)$, or 812 $(f(4) = 10, f(8) = 12)$, thus `?` must be outputted.

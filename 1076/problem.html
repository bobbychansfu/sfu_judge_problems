    <p>
        In the bustling city of Codetropolis, there lived a legendary hacker named Max. Max was renowned far and wide for their exceptional coding skills. One day, a mysterious message appeared in Max's inbox. It was a challenge from an anonymous sender.
The task? To create a mesmerizing pattern of numbers using nested loops. Intrigued, Max decided to take on the challenge. They understood that this wasn't just any coding taskâ€”it was a dive into the realms of creativity and complexity.

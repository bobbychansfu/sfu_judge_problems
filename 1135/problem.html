    <h1>Afu's Saving Plan</h1>
    <p>
        Afu Miyan has set a savings goal and is determined to save money every week until the goal is reached. However, the amount saved each week may vary. Afu needs a Python program to help track these varying weekly savings and determine how long it will take to reach the goal.
    </p>

    <p>
        You are to write a Python program that:	
        <ol>
            
            <li>Prompts the user to input their total savings goal.</li>
            <li>Continuously asks the user for their savings amount for each week until the savings goal is reached.</li>
            <li>Calculates the total savings and the number of weeks it took to reach or exceed the savings goal.</li>
            <li>Once the goal is reached or exceeded, prints a congratulatory message along with the total number of weeks it took to reach the goal.</li>

        </ol>
    </p>

   
    <h3>
        Input
    </h3>

    <p>
        An integer $G$ representing the total savings goal. <br>
        A series of integers representing the weekly savings amount. The series of integers will continue until the total savings goal is reached or exceeded.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Output
    </h3>

    <p>
        A congratulatory message stating the total number of weeks it took to reach the savings goal.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Sample Run 1
    </h3>
    <p>
        Here is a sample run of your program. Please note that the <b>bold text</b> represents user inputs and that the prompts must match the following <em>exactly</em> to get maximum points.
    </p>
    <p>
<pre>
Enter your savings goal: <b>500</b>
Enter your savings for week 1: <b>120</b>
Enter your savings for week 2: <b>130</b>
Enter your savings for week 3: <b>150</b>
Enter your savings for week 4: <b>100</b>
Congratulations! Number of weeks to reach your goal: 4
</pre>
    </p>

    <h1>Unlock the Tower</h1>
    <p>
        In a distant digital kingdom, there is a tower with a magical number lock programmed with a recursive sequence. The lock displays a number and asks for the next number in a special sequence. This sequence follows a rule: each number is the sum of the previous three numbers, starting with 1, 1, and 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the kingdom's most skilled programmer, your task is to unlock this tower by writing a recursive function in Python to find the $n^(th)$ number in this sequence, where $n$ is the position displayed by the lock.
    </p>

    <h3>Input Format</h3>

    <p>
        A single integer $n$ representing the position in the sequence.
    </p>

    <h3>Output</h3>

    <p>
        The $n^(th)$ number in the sequence.
    </p>

    <h3>Constraints</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>$1 \leq n \leq 50$</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
<h3>Sample Input 1</h3>
<pre>
7
</pre>
<h3>Sample Output 1</h3>
<pre>
24
</pre>
<p>
    <b>Explanation</b>: The first seven numbers in the sequence are 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24. The seventh number is 24.

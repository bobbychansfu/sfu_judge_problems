    <h1>Odd Even Multiples</h1>
    <p>
        Nathan often struggles to find odd and even multiples of a given number while doing his math homework. Nathan's father wants to help him by creating a program to find either odd or even multiples of a given number.
    </p>
    <p>    
    <ul>   
        <li>The user must enter a number for which they want to find the multiples.	</li>
        <li>The user must specify whether they want to find even or odd multiples.</li>
        <li>The user must enter how many multiples they want to generate.</li>
        <li>The user is assumed to enter either "even" or "odd"</li>

    </ul>
    </p>

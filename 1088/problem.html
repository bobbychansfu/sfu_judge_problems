    <h1>Memories</h1>
    <p>
        Finally! Amy is back on Earth. She gets out of her the pod and, surpirisingly uneventfully, gets back home.
    </p>
    <p>
        But what is this? She hears an annoyingly familliar sound, increasing in volume. 
        "Huh, that makes no se...", - Amy's thought was interrupted by her waking up from the alarm.
        She is back to reality, and her grand escape from an alien spaceship was nothing more than a <b>strange</b> dream.
        While the events are fresh in memory, she has to note the story (or most impressive part of the story) down.
        As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. Following that logic, an animation is worth thousands. 
        Being a peculliar CS student, Amy is much more comfortable with terminal art than any other form
        of content creation, and she only ever creates on a 80 x 24 Terminal window.
        As you have guessed, the task of creating this video now lays on your shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
  Write a program without input that outputs a video, or cool animation,
  to said terminal window. There is no need to use TTY, ncurses, or anything like that.
  You can simply re-print the whole screen with every frame.
  </p>
  <p>
  Also record your animation and upload it to your preferred cloud storage.
  Add a link to the video as a comment at the top of your program. Make sure the video is accessible
  to anyone with the link.
  </p>
  <p>
      You will receive 10 points for submitting this problem (and having it
      compile properly if needed), but at the end
      of the contest, <b>only your latest submission will be judged
          manually.
      </b>
      <br>
      You will be marked out of 100 points for video quality, artistry,
      and creativity.
      <br>
      The video can not take more than 30 seconds to complete, as the judges
      have only a certain amount of time.
      <br>
      If you have problems submitting or anything, please come ask the judges
      to view your video at your computer, and they will mark you from there.

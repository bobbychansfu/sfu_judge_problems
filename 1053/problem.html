    <h1>Data Domains</h1>
    <p>
        A data domain is a set of values that can be assigned to a particular data element or attribute, which helps ensure data integrity and consistency in a database. 
    </p> 
    <p>
        A specialization of the data domains problem is when we need to determine whether a list of numbers falls within a specified range of integers. Write a program that reads a list of integers separated by a single space in the first line. In the next two lines, the program should read two integers $i$ and $j$, where $i$ &lt; $j$. The program should then determine whether all the integers in the list fall within the range of $i$ and $j$ (inclusive) and print 'yes' or 'no' accordingly.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        The first line will contain $n$ integers separated by whitespaces. The second contains the variables $i$ and $j$ separated by a whitespace.
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        the string 'yes' or 'no'
    </p>

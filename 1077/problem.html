    <h1>Blackjack Scoring</h1>
    <p>
        In a game of general blackjack, a player receives n cards. The objective is to achieve a score as close to 7n as possible without exceeding it. Here's how the scoring works:
        <ul>
            <li>Cards numbered 2 through 10 are scored at their face value (i.e., 2 through 10 points).</li>
            <li>Face cards (Jack, Queen, King), numbered 11 through 13 are each scored as 10 points.</li>
            <li>The Ace card, numbered 1, can be scored as either 1 or 11 points, whichever results in a better score for the player.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Write a program that:
        <ol>
            <li>Asks the user for an integer n representing the number of cards.</li>
            <li>Prompts the user to input card values between 1 and 13, a total of $n$ times.</li>
            <li>Outputs:
                <ul>
                    <li>"Busted" if the total score of the n cards exceeds 7n.</li>
                    <li>"Blackjack" if the total score of the n cards is exactly 7n.</li>
                    <li>The total score if neither of the above conditions is met.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

        Sample Run 1
    </h3>
    <p>
        Here is a sample run of your program. Please note that the <b>bold text</b> represents user inputs. Please note that the prompts must match the following <em>exactly</em> to get maximum points.
    </p>
    <p>
<pre>
Number of cards (n): <b>2</b>
Card 1 (between 1 and 13): <b>2</b>
Card 2 (between 1 and 13): <b>3</b>
5
</pre>
    </p>

    <h3>
        Sample Run 2
    </h3>
    
    <p>
<pre>
Number of cards (n): <b>2</b>
Card 1 (between 1 and 13): <b>3</b>
Card 2 (between 1 and 13): <b>1</b>
Blackjack
</pre>
Explanation: The card valued at 3 is worth 3 points. In this case, the card with a value of 1 is counted as 11, as it benefits the player. Thus, 3 + 11 equals 14, which is 7 times 2. Therefore, it's a blackjack.

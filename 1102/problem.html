    <h1>Marking Attendance</h1>
    <p>
        A kindergarten teacher needs to mark attendance but faces a challenge: the children are active and do not stay seated during roll call. To manage this, the teacher decides to write a Python program to record each student's name without repetition, as the attendance sheet has limited space.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your task is to write a Python program that allows the teacher to input student names one at a time. The teacher will enter 'n' to finish the input process. The program should then display all unique student names in alphabetical order, separated by commas.

    <p>
        Here's how a sample run of Malcus's grocery shopping program might look (Note: the <b>bold</b> text represents user input):
<pre>
Enter a student's name or 'n' to stop: <b>Jay</b>
Enter a student's name or 'n' to stop: <b>Bob</b>
Enter a student's name or 'n' to stop: <b>Manav</b>
Enter a student's name or 'n' to stop: <b>Jeel</b>
Enter a student's name or 'n' to stop: <b>Varsha</b>
Enter a student's name or 'n' to stop: <b>Jeel</b>
Enter a student's name or 'n' to stop: <b>n</b>
List without duplicates, sorted alphabetically: Bob, Jay, Jeel, Manav, Varsha

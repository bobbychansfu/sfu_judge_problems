    <h1>Broken Spiral</h1>
    <p>
        With the language decoder handy, Amy is now roaming around the ship hallways, hoping to find some clues on how to get out.
        The ship is huge and the corridors seem endless. Each room has a letter on it, but they don't make a lot of sense to Amy.
        Naturally, she cannot just barge into every single room, as she risks being detected, and Amy is not really interested
        in learning what that entails. After spending what seemed an eternity sneaking around this infernal ship,
        she could not find a single map or an info table! "These guys rely on technology way too much",
        thinks Amy. Who knows, maybe she is right. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, she notices a tiny door with a shy, tattered label: "Archive" (as shown on the decoder device).
      Amy tries the handle, and it budges! She goes in. Among the piles of useless stuff, our friend sees a ripped-in-half
      poster, which could be a map of the ship. Okay, we can work with this!
    </p>
    <p>
      The map contains letters formed in what could have been a spiral starting from A, alphabetically - that is,
      if not for the ripped off part. At the bottom, there is a legend: 
      "A - Apodyterium, B - Bathroom, C - Cafeteria, ... P - Pod Station ...". That's what we are looking for!
      Unfortunately, to understand where Amy is, the whole map is required, so Amy now
      need to restore the ripped off part. Her decoder device has some memory left, so she decides to add the
      map restoring functionality to it as well. Given limited memory though, she wants the program to be
      as short as possible.

    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        The input will consist of a single integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 100$), the size of the original poster.
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        Output the other half of the map.
        Please be careful with whitespace, as the solution is sensitive to whitespace
        used.

<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>
    You will get 50 points for submitting a working solution.
</p>
<p>
    The length of your code will be counted in number of ASCII characters.
    Furthermore, for each language, points will be assigned as follows:
    <br>
    - Shortest code - 100 points<br>
    - 2nd shortest code - 83 points<br>
    - 3rd shortest code - 67 points<br>
    You can only get points for one language, and the language in which you scored 
    the highest will give you points. This means that you can deny teams points by
    scoring well in multiple languages.

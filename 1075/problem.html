    <h1>Treasure Hunter</h1>
    <p>
        You are Lara Croft, and you've stumbled upon an ancient map that leads to hidden treasure. The map contains a peculiar instruction: "To unlock the treasure chest, you must recite all the even numbers from 2 up to the magical number $n$ engraved on the chest."
    </p>
    <p>
        Write a Python program that simulates this treasure hunt. The program should prompt the user (the treasure hunter) to input the magical number $n$ engraved on the treasure chest. Then, display all the even numbers from 2 up to and including $n$. Only by doing this will the treasure chest unlock. <br>
        If the user enters a number less than 2, display a message indicating that the input is invalid and prompt the user to enter a valid number. After displaying all the even numbers up to n, print a congratulatory message indicating that the treasure chest is unlocked.

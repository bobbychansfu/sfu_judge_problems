    <h1>Impossible Problem</h1>
    <p>
    This is the description of the problem. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
	Here is where you'll find a general description of the problem.  A nice story to wrap around some algorithmic concept.  
    </p>
    <p>
    You can type in your code to you left or copy and paste code from an editor. Remember to choose the correct compiler/interpreter under "language"

This question doesn't have a correct answer so anything you submit will be wrong.  This will not be the case in a real contest
    </p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        This is where the inputs description will be. For example: input will contain a number N ($2 \leq N \leq 100$),
        the number of students at a programming contest.
    </p>
    <p>
    And so on ....
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        Here is where Outputs will be described. For example: Output the sum of the first $N$ positive even number: $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N 2i$.

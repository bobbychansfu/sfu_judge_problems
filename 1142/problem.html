    <h1>Have You Considered That Primes and Palindromes Start With The Same Letter?</h1>
    <p>
        Caligula actually came across this funny fact one day and then started wondering about prime numbers.
        Of course, she has already figured out all the [palindromic primes](https://oeis.org/A002385), so she
        comes up with a special type of prime called a Paligulaprime. For any positive integer X,
        X is a Paligulaprime if the conditions below hold:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>X >= 10</li>
        <li>X is prime</li>
        <li>X//10 is a palindrome</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It is here that Caligula gets a delivery in the mail, which happens to be
        lots and <i>lots</i> of boxes of purple cookies, as well as a pretty much infinite amount of purple cookie dough.
        Caligula looks at the many boxes and gets dizzy because there are so many! To help her
        calm down, she decides to make each box contain a Paligulaprime number of purple cookies.
        Caligula can do two actions to achieve this, both of which take exactly 1 minute each:
    </p>
        
    <ul> 
        <li>Caligula can bake exactly 1 purple cookie and place it in any box.</li>

        <li>
            Caligula can take out 1 purple cookie from any box, which then for some reason will always immediately disintegrate
            into a syrupy mess of sugar in her hands, meaning she cannot move this cookie to another box.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It just so happens for Caligula that <i>there are a lot of puple cookies</i>. So much so that Caligula is unsure
        what the minimum amount of time she'll need to make sure every box has a Paligulaprime number of cookies.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        The first line will contain a positive integer $n$ indicating the 
        number of boxes that were sent. N will be at most 599959, which coincidentally happens to be a Paligulaprime.
</p>
   <p>
    The second line will contain $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, a_3,... a_n  (1 \leq a_i \leq 1234567)$ - the number of purple cookies in each box.      
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        Output a singular number indicating the minimum number of minutes required to have 
        every box contain a Paligulaprime number of purple cookies.
    </p>
 
    <h2>Sample 1</h2>
    <h3><code>stdin</code></h3>
    <pre>
3
7 13 28
    </pre>
    <h3><code>stdout</code></h3>
    <pre>
5    
</pre>
    <p>
        The first few Paligulaprimes are 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. 
        Caligula can bake 4 cookies in 4 minutes to be placed in the first box so that 11 purple cookies are in there.
        She can then bake 1 more cookie in 1 minute and place it in the third box so that is contains 29 purple cookies. 
        13 is already a Paligulaprime so no cookies need to be added or removed.
        In total, this will take $4 + 0 + 1 = 5$ minutes.
    </p>
    <h2>Sample 2</h2>
    <h3><code>stdin</code></h3>
    <pre>
1
444444

    </pre>
    <h3><code>stdout</code></h3>
    <pre>
1
    </pre>

<p>Caligula can remove 1 cookie from the box, which will take 1 minute. (They're special cookies.)</p>

<h2>Scoring</h2>

<p>
    To attain a number of points equal to the 11th lowest Paligulaprime (ie. 47 points), 
    $n$ will be at most 23.
    
    The remaining number of points equal to the 12th lowest Paligulaprime (ie. 53 points) have no restrictions on the input.

    <h1>Bob the Builder's Starry Design</h1>
    <p>
        Mr. Bob The Builder is working on a unique architectural design involving star patterns for a new building. Each floor of the building will have a symmetrical star pattern, and there is a cost associated with each star in the design. Your task is to help Mr. Bob by creating a program that generates a sample star pattern for the building and calculates the cost based on the number of stars and floors.
    </p>
    <h3>Input</h3>
    <p>
        The program should take two integers as input separated by a space:
        <ul>
            <li>
                The first is the number of stars $s$ in the horizontal symmetry line of the design ($1 \leq s \leq 100$).
            </li>
            <li>
                The second is the number of floors $f$ in the building ($1 \leq f \leq 100$).
            </li>
        </ul>
        Please note there are no prompts for this question
    </p>
   
    <h3>Output</h3>
    <p>
        The program should output two things:
        <ul>
            <li>
                A sample design showing the symmetrical star pattern for the given number of stars and floors. Each floor repeats the same star pattern.
            </li>
            <li>
                The total cost of the design, calculated as the number of stars in the whole building (across all floors) multiplied by &dollar;5 (since each star costs &dollar;5).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

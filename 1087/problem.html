    <h1>Dicey Multiples</h1>
    <p>
        In the bustling city of Computopolis, there's an annual festival where brilliant minds showcase their logic skills in games of chance and skill. This year, the highlight is a unique dice game called "Dicey Multiples."
    </p> 
    <p>
        You are provided with two standard six-sided dice. Your challenge is to define a function <code>printDiceCombinations(n)</code>. This function will take a positive integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 12$) as a parameter and print all possible combinations in which the sum of the numbers rolled on the two dice is a multiple of $n$. Each die has six faces, numbered from 1 to 6.
    </p>
    <p>
        For each valid combination, print the numbers on the two dice, separated by a space. Each combination should be printed on a new line, and the combinations must be printed in sorted order, first by the number on the first die and then by the number on the second die. 
    </p>
       
To complete this task, you can the provided sample code and write the <code>printDiceCombinations(n)</code> function. Do not change anything else in the code.  <br>
<code>printDiceCombinations(6)</code> prints out: 
<pre>
1 5
2 4
3 3
4 2
5 1
6 6
</pre>

<p>
    Explanation: the first 5 rows results in a total of 6, which is divisible by 6. The last row results in a total of 12, which is also divisible by 6.

    <h1>Perfect Numbers</h1>
    <p>
        In the mystical land of Numeralia, numbers have a life of their own. Among them, there's a special class of numbers that are considered "perfect." A number is deemed perfect if it's a positive integer that equals the sum of its positive divisors, excluding itself. For instance, the number $28$ is perfect because its positive divisors are $1$, $2$, $4$, $7$, and $14$, and their sum is $28$.

    <p>
        Your task, brave coder, is to embark on a quest to find all these perfect numbers hiding between two given numbers.
    </p>
   
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        Two integers, $a$ and $b$ ($1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^4$) separated by a space. Please note there are no user prompts for this question.
    </p>

    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
    
        A list of all perfect numbers between $a$ and $b$, inclusive. If there are no perfect numbers in the range, output "-1"

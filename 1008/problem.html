    <h1>Interesting Idea</h1>
    <p>
        Bob is teaching Alice about proper code and proper documentation.
        Alice, being familiar with competitive programming, is unfamiliar
        with these concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
        He asks for your help with an interesting example.
    </p>
    <h1>
        Task
    </h1>
    <p>
        Write an <i>interesting</i> program in one of the given languages,
        that accepts input through stdin and gives output through stdout.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, make sure that your program is <b>well-documented</b>
        and that it is as easy as possible for someone to read your source code,
        even if they do not know the language.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will receive 10 points for submitting this problem (and having it
        compile properly if needed), but at the end
        of the contest, <b>only your latest submission will be judged
            manually.
        </b>
        <br>
        You will be marked out of 50 points for proper, complete, and precise
        documentation and code style.
        <br>
        You will be marked out of 50 points based on how interesting or impressive
        your program is.
        Remember that it can only be interesting and impressive if the judges
        can understand it.

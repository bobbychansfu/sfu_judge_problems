    <h1>Nubby's Number Farm</h1>
    <p>
        The owners of Nubby's Number Factory were amazed by how well it worked
        and all the HUGE numbers it created!
        But they are ambitious, and decided to make Nubby the mascot
        of their new number farm as well!
    </p>
    <p>
        The digit plants have grown, so now it's your turn to use Nubby
        to harvest them.
        The plants have all been grown in a row, and each digit plant
        has a digit from $1$ to $9$.
        When using Nubby to harvest a plant, however, he destroys both
        plants next to it.
    </p>
    <p>
        After you harvest the plants, make sure to place them side by side
        to make as large of a number as you can!
    </p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        The first line will contain an integer $n$, the number of plants.
        The second line will contain a string of $n$ digits, each a number
        between $1$ and $9$.
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        Print the largest number that you can make by harvesting plants with
        Nubby and putting them in any order you choose.

    <h1>Ghost Month</h1>
    <p>
        In Malaysia, during the ghost month, there are several taboos that elders often remind children about. Listed below are a few of these taboos:
        <ol>
            <li>Going out during midnight.</li>
            <li>Taking photos at night as one pleases.</li>
            <li>Drying clothes outside at night.</li>
            <li>Going near water.</li>
            <li>Patting people on the shoulder.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        Write a program that asks the user whether they adhere to these taboos.
    </p>
    <ul>    
        <li>For each taboo, the program should prompt the user with a yes/no question.</li>
        <li>If the user responds with anything other than 'yes' or 'no', the program should re-prompt the user for that specific taboo.</li>
        <li>If the user responds 'yes' to any of the taboos, the program should terminate immediately and output: 'Uh oh! Ghosts are coming for you!'</li>
        <li>If the user responds 'no' to all the taboos, the program should output: 'You are the taboo master!'</li>

    </ul>
    <p>

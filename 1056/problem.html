    <h1>Liste Addition</h1>
    <p>
        Ms. Liste (pronounced 'liÂ·stee') is a cool teacher who loves teaching third-grade students how to add and subtract 
        numbers. She wants her students to understand the importance of basic arithmetic operations. 
        One day, she gave her students a new math problem. She provided them with two lists of positive numbers and 
        asked them to add the elements in a new list. However, there was a twist to the problem! She wanted her 
        students to break down the sum into individual digits if it turned out to be a two (or more) -digit number. 
        This cool idea has come to be known as "Liste addition".  
    </p>
    <p>
        Your task is to write a program that reads the first two lines of input, which represent two lists of positive 
        numbers separated by commas ','. Then, output the result of the "Liste addition" list separated by commas.
    </p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        The first line will contain $n$ integers separated by commas. 
        The second line will contain $m$ integers separated by commas. $n$ and $m$ may not necessarily be equal.
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        Liste addition applied to the two lines of input. The result must be printed with a comma between each element.

<h3>Sample Run 1</h3>
<p>
    Here is a sample run of your program. Please note that the <b>bold text</b> represents user inputs. Please note that there are no prompts in this question.
</p>
<h3>Sample Run 1</h3>
<pre>
<b>23,5,2,7,87</b>
<b>4,67,2,8</b>
2,7,7,2,4,1,5,8,7
</pre>
<p>Explanation 1: The pairwaise addition of the two lists results in [27,72,4,15,87]. The numbers that have more 
    than one digit must be separated, which results in [2,7,7,2,4,1,5,8,7]</p>

<h3>Sample Run 2</h3>
<pre>
<b>123</b>
<b>4,67,2,8</b>
1,2,7,6,7,2,8
</pre>
<p>Explanation 1: The pairwaise addition of the two lists results in [127,67,2,8]. The numbers that have more 
    than one digit must be separated, which results in [1,2,7,6,7,2,8]</p>

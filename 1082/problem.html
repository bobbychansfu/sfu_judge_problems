    <h1>Bedtime</h1>
    <p>
        It's midterm season over at Strange & Fabulous University, and while many students are trying their hardest
        to prepare for their exams, some have opted for rather unconventional activities.
        For instance, instead of hitting the books, a fraction of students are participating in weird competitions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Our protagonist in this story, Amy, albeit a diligent student, has also chosen the latter option,
      despite having an important exam scheduled for the following day.
      Although the event turned out to be a lot of fun, and Amy made some new friends,
      she ultimately had to spend the entire evening and a significant portion of the subsequent night cramming for her exam.

      Now, feeling both content with her knowledge and utterly exhausted, she's ready to hit the sack.
      However, there's a twist to her predicament â€” as her phone was recently purchased, the time settings are all messed up!
      This task is proving to be quite a challenge for Amy's sleepy mind, and she's in need of some assistance.

    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        The input will consist of two lines.
        The first line will display the time, denoted as $t_1$, on Amy's phone in a 12-hour format <code>(hh:mm:ss am/pm)</code>
        The second line will indicate the time, denoted as $t_2$, at which her alarm is set, also in the same 12-hour format.
        It's important to note that due to different timezones, the alarm time might not necessarily be in the AM.
        ($t_1 \le t_2$) and ($0 \le t_2 - t_1 \le 24H$)
    </p>
    <h2> Output</h2>

      Output number of minutes that Amy gets to rest, rounding down.

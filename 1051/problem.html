    <h1>Translating Romans</h1>
    <p>
        Bob is trying to teach his son Jacob to read Roman Numerals, but he's not very motivated. So, he's asked you to help by writing a program to convert Roman Numerals to integers.
    </p> 
    <p>
        Roman numerals are a way of writing numbers using seven symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M. Each symbol has a specific value, as shown below:
    </p>
    <table class="table">
        <tr>
            <th>Symbol</th><th>Value</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>I</td><td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>V</td><td>5</td>
        </tr> 
        <tr>
            <td>X</td><td>10</td>
        </tr> 
        <tr>
            <td>L</td><td>50</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>C</td><td>100</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>D</td><td>500</td>
        </tr>
         <tr>   
            <td>M</td><td>1000</td>
           
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        You use combinations of these symbols to write a number in Roman numerals. For example, the number 2 is written as II in Roman numerals, which is simply two ones added together. The number 12 is written as XII, which is just 10 plus 2. And the number 27 is written as XXVII, which is 20 plus 5 plus 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        When writing Roman numerals, you usually write the largest symbols first and the smallest symbols last, from left to right. However, there are some exceptions. For instance, instead of writing IIII for the number 4, you write IV, which means 5 minus 1. Similarly, instead of writing VIIII for the number 9, you write IX, which means 10 minus 1. There are only six instances where subtraction is used like this:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>For 4, we put I (1) before V (5)  </li>
        <li>For 9, we put I (1) before X (10)  </li>
        <li>For 4, we put X (10) before L (50)  </li>
        <li>For 9, we put X (10) before C (100)  </li>
        <li>For 400, we put C (100) before D (500)</li>
        <li>For 900, we put C (100) before M (1000)</li>
    </ul>    
To complete this task, you can download the provided sample code and write the <code>romanToInts(s)</code> function. This function should take a string representing a Roman Numeral as input and then return the corresponding integer as output. Do not change anything else in the code.  <br>
<code>romanToInt("III")</code> returns <code>3</code> <br>
<code>romanToInt("LVIII")</code> returns <code>58</code> <br>
<code>romanToInt("MCMXCIV")</code> returns <code>1994</code> <br>

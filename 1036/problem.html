    <h1>Floating Jacob</h1>
    <p>
        Little Jacob is learning floating point numbers. His dad Bob, being lazier than most, would like to teach his son by writing a program to report the relativity of two floating-point numbers entered from the console.  Can you help Bob write this program so he can return to watching <em>Squid Games</em>?
    </p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        Prompt the user by asking for numbers x and y.
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        A single line that prints out the relativity of these numbers. Print
        <ul>
            <li>"x and y are the same" if x and y are equal. Replace x and y in the string with their values. Otherwise,</li>
            <li>"a is less than b", where is a is the min of x and y, and b is the max of x and y</li>
        </ul> 
    </p>
<h3>Sample Run 1</h3>
<p>
    Here is a sample run of your program. Please note that the <b>bold text</b> represents user inputs. Please note that the prompts must match the following <em>exactly</em> to get maximum points.
</p>
<pre>
x? <b>50.5</b> 
y? <b>50.3</b> 
50.3 is less than 50.5
</pre>

<h3>Sample Run 2</h3>
<pre>
x? <b>-99.5</b> 
y? <b>100.3</b> 
-99.5 is less than 100.3
</pre>

<h3>Sample Run 3</h3>
<pre>
x? <b>-9.545</b> 
y? <b>-9.545</b> 
-9.545 and -9.545 are the same
</pre>

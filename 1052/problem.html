    <h1>String Shuffler</h1>
    <p>
        Joe has an interesting job as a "string shuffler." As a string shuffler, he takes two strings and makes a new list of all the possible combinations of their characters while keeping their original order. For example, if Bob is given the strings "ABC" and "ACB," the list of shuffled strings are: <br>
        ACBABC, AABCBC, ACABCB, ABCACB, AACBBC, ABACCB, ACABBC, ABACBC, AACBCB, AABCCB
        
    </p> 
    <p>
        Another example, if Joe is given the strings "ABC" and "DE," the shuffled strings would be <br>
        ABCDE, ABDCE, ADBCE, DABCE, DABEC, DAEBC, DEABC
        </p>
        <p>
        Joe needs some help writing a function called "shuffleAll(X,Y)" that takes two input strings X and Y and returns a shuffled list of strings from X and Y. To do this, he might need to write some other functions to help him, which could be recursive. 

    </p>

To complete this task, you can download the provided sample code and write the <code>shuffleAll(X,Y)</code> function. Do not change anything else in the code.  <br>
<code>shuffleAll("ABC","ACB")</code> returns <code>[ 'ACBABC', 'AABCBC', 'ACABCB', 'ABCACB', 'AACBBC', 'ABACCB', 'ACABBC', 'ABACBC', 'AACBCB', 'AABCCB' ]</code> in any order and without duplicates. <br>
<code>shuffleAll("ABC","DE")</code> returns <code>[ 'ABCDE', 'ABDCE', 'ABDEC', 'ADBCE', 'ADBEC', 'ADEBC', 'DABCE', 'DABEC', 'DAEBC', 'DEABC' ]</code> in any order and without duplicates.

    <h1>Spelling Bee</h1>
    <p>
        In this spelling competition at SFU, contestants score points based on the vowels in their spelled words. Here's a breakdown of how each vowel contributes to the score:
    </p>    
    <ul>
        <li>'a' earns 2 points.</li>
        <li>'e' gets 1 point.</li>
        <li>'i' fetches 3 points.</li>
        <li>'o' and 'u' each contribute 0.5 points.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    To maximize their score, contestants should focus on spelling words that contain vowels with higher point values. However, if there's a tie in points, the length of the word becomes the tiebreaker, adding an additional competitive element. 

</p>
<p>
    For example, a contestant might strategize to spell longer words that include 'i' (3 points) and 'a' (2 points) to maximize their score. Shorter words with 'e' (1 point) might be chosen if they are easier to spell quickly.

</p>
<p>
    This setup not only tests spelling accuracy but also strategic thinking in choosing words that balance vowel points and word length effectively. It adds excitement to the competition as participants aim to outscore each other with their word choices.

    <p>
    Write a function called
<code>calculate_points(word)</code> <br>
Parameters: <br>
<ul>
    <li>word: The string of the spelling word</li>
</ul>
Returns: the number points that the spelling word is worth.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        To complete this task, you can download the provided sample code and write the <code>calculate_points(word)</code> function; do not change anything else in the code.  <br>
        <code>calculate_points("banana")</code> returns <code>6.0</code> <br>
        <code>calculate_points("example")</code> returns <code>4.0</code> 
     
    </p>

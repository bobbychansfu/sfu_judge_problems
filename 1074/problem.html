    <h1>Grace Exams</h1>
    <p>
        Grace is a student preparing for her upcoming exams and would like a program to determine if she has prepared well enough. Write a program to help her with the following requirements:
    </p>
    <p>
        The program should ask the user to enter the number of days she has left to study before the exam (referred to as D-Day). <br>
        It should then ask for the total number of mock exams she needs to pass before D-Day. <br>
        For each day leading up to D-Day, the program should ask the user how many mock exams she completed that day.
    </p>
    <p>
        If she completes at least the required number of mock exams by D-Day, the program should output: "D-Day! Your exam will go as planned". <br>
        If she completes fewer mock exams than required by D-Day, the program should output: "D-Day! Still, hope for the best."
    </p>

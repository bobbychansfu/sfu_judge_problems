    <h1>Prime Number Game</h1>
    <p>
        John and Mia love playing number games. They have recently come up with a new game that involves prime factors. Here's how the game works:

    <ol>
        <li>Each player chooses a number.</li>
        <li>They find the prime factors of their chosen numbers.</li>
        <li>They sum up the prime factors (counting repeated factors as many times as they occur).</li>
        <li>If the sums of the prime factors of their numbers are equal, they win. Otherwise, they lose.</li>
    </ol>

    Your task is to write a program that determines whether John and Mia win or lose the game based on the numbers they choose.
	
    </p>
    
   
    <h3>
        Input
    </h3>

    <p>
        The first line contains two integers $A$ and $B$, where $1 \leq A, B \leq 10^6$ representing the numbers chosen by John and Mia, respectively.    </p>

    <h3>
        Output
    </h3>

    <p>
        Print "Win" if John and Mia win the game (i.e., the sums of the prime factors of $A$ and $B$ are equal), and "Lose" otherwise.
    </p>

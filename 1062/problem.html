    <h1>Moving Day</h1>
    <p>
        In Korea, there are many myths around moving on certain lunar calendar dates. Specifically, people tend to avoid moving into new places on dates ending in 9 or 0 in the lunar calendar. For example, January 9th on the lunar calendar would be considered an unfavorable move-in date.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, moving in winter (defined as November through January) is not ideal, as it is more difficult to inspect the condition of a new home in cold weather.

    </p>
    <p>
        Please write a program that:
<ul>
    <li>
        Prompts the user to input a desired move-in date in the format "MM DD" (e.g. "11 1" for November 1st)
    </li>
    <li>
        Checks if the input date falls on a lunar date ending in 9 or 0
    </li>
    <li>
        Checks if the input date falls within November, December, or January
    </li>
    <li>
        Prints output stating whether the input date is considered a good or bad day to move in, based on the lunar date and winter season factors.

    </li>
</ul>
    </p>
        
    <h2> Input</h2>

    <p>
        One line with the month $m$ and day $d$ separated by a space.
    </p>

    <h2> Output</h2>

    <p>
        One line stating "It is a good day to move in" or "It is not a good day to move in".
    </p>

    <h2>Constraints</h2>

    <p>
        $1 \le m \le 12$ <br>
        $1 \le d \le 31$
    </p>

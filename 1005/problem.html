    <h1>Smart Sort</h1>
    <p>
        Alice just designed a really smart computer: a fully parallel computer!
        She managed to get it partially funded by an anonymous benefactor,
        and is now building it.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, her benefactor has recently asked her a question that made her
        blood run cold:
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>"What's the use of such a computer?"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        Being a theoretical computer scientist, Alice has no clue how to answer.
        She comes to you for help, and you suggest doing a simple task:
        sorting a list of numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alice is stunned! This is a wonderful idea, she's sure that her computer
        could do it faster than a regular one.
        However, she's busy building, so tasks you with writing the sorting program.

    <h2>Interaction</h2>
    <p>
        <b>
            This is an interactive problem.
        </b>
        This means that you have to be extra careful with whitespace and formatting.
        Output no extra newlines, and exit your code the moment you receive a "-1".
        The judge will start off by sending you a line of input with two integers:
        $n$, the number of elements of the list, and $m$, the number of batches of
        parallel instructions you have, including the one used to solve the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can send queries of two kinds: a set of parallel instructions
        or a solution
    </p>
    <p>
        To send a set of $k$ ($k \leq \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$) parallel instructions,
        output
    </p>
    <p class="monospace">
            q k
    </p>
    <p>
        on a line by itself, then $k$ instructions (each on a line by themselves, numbers and comparators seperated by whitespace):
    </p>
<pre>
a &lt; b
</pre> or 
<pre>
a &gt; b
</pre>
    <p>
        Once all instructions have been sent as a batch, the judge will respond to all of them on a single line.
        In order, it will output 0 if the instruction was false, and 1 if correct.
        If you sent too many instructions, batches, or your formatting was incorrect, a single
        -1 will be sent, and you must exit your program.
    </p>
    <p>
        To submit an answer: print 'a', then the sorted list indices on a single line, seperated by whitespace.
        The judge will either respond with '1', meaning that you are correct, or '-1', meaning
        that you are wrong. Either way, exit the program.
    </p>
    <h3>Cases:</h3>
    <p>30 Points: $2 \leq n \leq 10, m = 100$</p>
    <p>70 Points: $2 \leq n \leq 100, m = 100$</p>
    <p>100 Points: $2 \leq n \leq 1000, m = 100$</p>

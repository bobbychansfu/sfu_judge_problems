    <h1>ParentBot</h1>
    <p>
        It is a known fact that aliens periodically abduct people to do small experiments on them before returning them home a few days later. During this time, they will replace the real human with a life-like robot that resembles their humans. Zergiug has been tasked with writing the logic for a ParentBot, who will ask the kids four questions. Every time answer is ‘yes’, the points increase. The questions are:
        <ul>
            <li>Did you eat?</li>
            <li>Did you study?</li>
            <li>Did you do your laundry?</li>
            <li>Did you call grandma?</li>
        </ul>
        
        At the end, ParentBot will reply as follows.
        <ul>
            <li>0 points: We need to talk.</li>
            <li>1-2 points: Ok.</li>
            <li>3-4 points: Good!</li>
        </ul>
        Please help Zerguig write this program.

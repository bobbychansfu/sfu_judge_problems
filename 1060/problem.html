    <h1>Mr. Milkman</h1>
    <p>
        Your mother has sent you to the milkman with a cylindrical bottle. You have to pay the milkman the price for the bottle at a rate of $\$2.35$ per litre of milk. You are given the radius ($r$) and the height ($h$) of the bottle in centimetres. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You can assume the value of $\pi$ as 3.14.
    </p>
    <p>
        The formula for the volume of a cylinder is: <br>
        $V = \pi r^2 h $ <br>
        Also, $1$ litre = $1000 cm^3$.

    </p>
    <h2> Input</h2>

    <p>
        Two lines, first line contains an integer $r$, the bottle's radius. The second line contains an integer $h$, the bottle's height in centimeters. 
    </p>

    <h2> Output</h2>

    <p>
        The amount you need to pay to the milkman, accurate up to 2 decimal places.
    </p>

    <h2>Constraints</h2>

    <p>
        $0 \le r \le 1000$ <br>
        $0 \le h \le 1000$
    </p>

    <h1>Great Grade Quest</h1>
    <p>
        After a long and challenging semester, Grace finally gets a moment to breathe. The campus is quiet, with most students already heading home for the holidays. The golden hues of the setting sun cast a warm glow on the university's iconic clock tower. Grace, sitting on the steps of the library, reflects on the semester gone by. She's curious about her performance and wants to know her average grade across all the subjects she took.
    </p>
    <p>
        Help Grace in her quest to find out her average grade rounded to 2 decimal places!
        <ul>
            <li>First, ask Grace how many courses she took this semester.</li>
            <li>For each course, ask her to input the final grade.</li>
            <li>Once all grades are entered, calculate and print out the average grade for the semester.</li> 
        </ul>
    </p>

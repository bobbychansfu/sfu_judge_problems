    <h1>Happiness Counter</h1>
    <p>
        In a magical land, there lived a young wizard named Elara, whose powers were linked to her emotions. Her happiness granted her the ability to cast enchanting spells, while her sadness weakened her magic. Elara discovered a mystical array of stones, each inscribed with an integer, representing the balance of her magical powers. She also found two ancient scrolls, each containing a unique set of integers. The first scroll, named 'Joy', contained numbers that boosted her happiness and powers. The second, called 'Sorrow', held numbers that drained her happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
        Elara's quest was to harness the power of these stones. Her happiness started at zero. For each stone she touched, if its number was on the 'Joy' scroll, her happiness and magic grew. But if the number was on the 'Sorrow' scroll, her powers diminished. Stones not listed on either scroll had no effect on her.
    </p>
    <p>
        Her task was simple yet daunting: to navigate through the list of stones, harnessing as much happiness as she could to reach her full magical potential. Elara needed to calculate her total happiness after this adventure to determine the extent of her powers. Would you help Elara calculate her final happiness and unlock the full potential of her magic?

    Explanation:
Elara gains happiness for the numbers 3 and 1 in the 'Joy' scroll. She loses happiness for the number 5 in the 'Sorrow' scroll. The number 7 on the 'Sorrow' scroll is not among the stones, so it doesn't affect her happiness. Thus, Elara's total happiness is 1.

    <h1>Counting People</h1>
    <p>
        Once upon a time in the small town of Codeville, the annual talent show was the event that brought everyone together. This year, the town's auditorium was packed with people eager to see the performances of their friends and family. The auditorium was arranged in a series of rows and columns, with some seats inevitably empty as some townsfolk were still backstage preparing for their acts.

    </p> 
    <p>
        As the organizer, you are tasked with a critical job: to count the total number of people seated in the auditorium before the show begins. The seating arrangement is given to you as a 2D list, where each sublist represents a row of seats, and the elements are the names of the people sitting in those seats. Some seats may be empty, represented by an empty string.
    </p>
    <p>
        Write a function <code>count_total_people</code> that takes this 2D list and returns the total count of people in the auditorium.

    </p>
   <p>
    To complete this task, you can the provided sample code and write the <code>count_total_people(seating_chart)</code> function, where <code>seating_chart</code> is a 2d list. Do not change anything else in the code.  <br>
   </p>   

<code>count_total_people([["Alice", "Bob", "", "Charlie"],["David", "", "Eve"],["", "Frank"]])</code> returns: <code>6</code> <br>

</p>

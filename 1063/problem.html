    <h1>Magic Library</h1>
    <p>
        In Vancouver, an extraordinary place stood, "The Enchanted Library." The library was managed by a friendly librarian named Anish.  He had a trusted assistant, Pranav, a wizard with a knack for creating enchanted books. This library held not only books but secrets of a magical world. To protect its treasures, assistant Pranav was asked to develop a unique automated check-out system. The library offered "Regular" and "Premium" memberships.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are tasked with designing a library check-out system for this magical library. The requirements are:
        <ul>
            <li>Regular members can check out up to 5 books at a time</li>
            <li>Premium members can check out up to 5 regular books plus restricted books</li>
            <li>All books can be checked out for up to 21 days</li>
            <li>If a regular member tries to check out more than 5 books or a restricted book, deny the check out</li>
            <li>If a user tries to keep any book for more than 21 days, remind them to return it</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Asks the user how many books they want to check out</li>
            <li>Asks if they need any restricted premium books</li>
            <li>Issues them a regular or premium membership based on their requests</li>
            <li>Allows check out if they abide by the rules or denies/reminds if they do not</li>
            <li>The program should handle all cases like maximum books, restricted books, and late returns based on the requirements.</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>Alpha Medely II</h1>

    <p>
        As we all know, alphabet soup is usually a tomato broth containing little pasta bits shaped like letters. For some people with OCD, they
        may have the tendacy to take each letter in the alphabet soup, lay them on their plate in a line, and then attempt to say the 
        jumbled up string of nonsense characters. Or maybe that's just me.       

    </p>

    <p>
        Anyways, after looking at the long string of pasta letters, I then eat some of them, removing them from the string. Upon doing so,
        I notice that there exists a substring where every single letter of the alphabet appears exactly once. In other words, there is a 
        sequence of exactly 26 consecutive characters in the string that are all unique. Now the question is, what is the fewest number of
        characters I removed to make this possible?
    </p>

    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        The first line contains an integer $s$, the length of the string.
        The second line contains the string, consisting of only lowercase letters.
    </p>
 
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        Print the minimum number of characters to delete so that there exists a continuous substring
        containing every letter exactly once. If it is impossible to create such a substring output `-1`.
    </p>
 
 <h2>Scoring</h2>
 <p>
    Case 1 (26 points):

    The string is at most 52 characters long.

 </p>    
 
 <p>
    Case 2 (26 points, 52 total):
    
    The string is at most 5200 characters long.

  </p>  

  <p>
    Case 2 (48 points, 100 total):
    
    The string is at most 520000 characters long. I ate a big bowl of alphabet soup.

  </p>  

  
  <h2>Sample 1</h2>
  <h3><code>stdin</code></h3>
  <p class="monospace">
    32
    cxxdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabzxfy
</p>

    <h3><code>stdout</code></h3>
    <p class="monospace">
        2    
    </p>

    <p>
        By deleting the 2nd and 3rd characters, there will be a substring of continuous characters `cdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzab`,
        which contains every letter of the alphabet exactly once.
    </p>

    <h2>Sample 2</h2>
    <h3><code>stdin</code></h3>
    <p class="monospace">
        32
        cccdefghijklmnoaqrstuvwxyzabzxfy
  </p>
  
      <h3><code>stdout</code></h3>
      <p class="monospace">
          -1    
      </p>
  
      <p>
        It is impossible to obtain a cyclic substring of the entire alphabet because the letter p is not in the string.

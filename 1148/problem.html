<h1>Trade Wars</h1>

<p>
    Strange times have fallen on the nation of Nacadia. A king of a neighboring
    nation has recently signed an order on "Trade and Regulation Impeding
    Free Flow". In retaliation, some neighbors of Nacadia have signed documents
    like "Tactical Assessment of Redundant Importation & Freight Fees", while
    others went so far as to implement a "Tyrannical Application of Regressive Import
    Fee Framework!" The T.A.R.I.F.F.s, as people started calling them,
    are now in full effect.
    To make matters worse, the cities of Nacadia have had a falling out
    as well, and are now imposing taxes on each other as well. Insanity!
</p>
<p>
    As an aid to the minister of trade, you have been tasked with 
    re-organizing the trade routes of the nation. The nation has N cities,
    and K of them are designated as trade hubs, who actively trade with the
    outside. You have a list of M potential trade routes, each connecting
    two cities, and each with a certain toll fee, equal in both directions.
    To minimize the impact on the economy, you want to build the routes in
    such a way that the sum of all toll fees is minimized, while ensuring
    that each city is connected to at least one trade hub.
</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>
On the first line, you will be given three integers $N$, $M$, and $K$
($1$ $\leq$ $N$ $\leq$ $2*10^5$, $1$ $\leq$ $M$ $\leq$ $2*10^5$, $1$ $\leq$ $K$ $\leq$ $N$).
</p>
<p>
Then, $M$ lines follow, each containing three integers $a$, $b$, and $c$
($1$ $\leq$ $a$, $b$ $\leq$ $N$, $1$ $\leq$ $c$ $\leq$ $10^9$), indicating that there is a trade route
between cities $a$ and $b$ with a toll fee of $c$.
</p>

Finally, you will be given $K$ integers $k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_K$ ($1$ $\leq$ $k_i$ $\leq$ $N$), the trade hubs.

<h2>Output</h2>
Output a single integer, the minimum sum of trade route toll fees.

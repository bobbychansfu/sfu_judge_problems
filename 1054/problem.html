    <h1>Crazy Letters</h1>
    <p>
        Susie really enjoys getting letters from her 200 friends. To make things easier, she gives each friend a number between 1 and 200. At the end of each month, she checks a list of numbers to see which friends sent her letters. If any friend wrote her more than 2 letters that month, she likes to give them a special treat. Susie needs some help making a program to find those special friends. The program reads line integers separated by a whitespace representing friends who sent her letters that month. It then outputs friends who sent Susie more than 2 letters in sorted order.

    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        The first line will contain $n$ integers separated by whitespaces, where $n$ is the total number of letters received that month.

    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        The friends, in sorted order, who wrote Susie more than 2 times

    <h1>BackwardsTown</h1>
    <p>
        In the heart of the whimsical world of Backwardstown, where life unfurled in a unique reverse, young math enthusiast Ellie discovered a curious parallel between her town's backward ways and the properties of numbers. She devised a function, 'reversedInteger,' capable of turning any integer—negative, zero, or positive—tail-to-head, much like the daily life in her town. This function meticulously mirrored the town's essence, right down to keeping the '-' sign of negative numbers at the forefront, proving that even in a number's reverse, its core identity held steadfast. 
    </p> 
    <p>
        Inspired by the story of Ellie from Backwardstown, where everything is uniquely reversed, your task is to recreate her 'reversedInteger' function. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The function should meet the following criteria:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>It must be named 'reversedInteger'.</li>
        <li>It should take one integer as an argument. The integer can be negative, zero, or positive. </li>
        <li>It should return an integer that consists of the digits of the input integer but in reverse order. </li>
        <li>For negative integers, the '-' sign should remain at the beginning. </li>
    </ul>    
To complete this task, you can the provided sample code and write the <code>reversedInteger(number)</code> function. Do not change anything else in the code.  <br>
<code>reversedInteger("0")</code> returns <code>0</code> <br>
<code>reversedInteger("123")</code> returns <code>321</code> <br>
<code>reversedInteger("-14500")</code> returns <code>-541</code> <br>

</p>

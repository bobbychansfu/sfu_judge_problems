    <h1>Bob's Cubes</h1>
    <p>
        Bob loves Rubik's cubes of all sizes.  Given that he has a cube with each edge measuring length a, he would like to know the cube's surface area and volume.
    </p>
    <p>
        A cube has 6 sides, and the formulae for the area and volume are:
    </p>
    <p>
        Surface Area = $6a^2$ <br>
        Volume = $a^3$
    </p>
    <h2> Input</h2>

    <p>
        One line with an integer $a$ denoting the side-length of the cube. 
        Do not prompt the user in this question.
    </p>

    <h2> Output</h2>

    <p>
        2 space-separated integers denoting the surface area and volume of the cube respectively.
    </p>

    <h2>Constraints</h2>

    <p>
        $0 \le n \le 100$
    </p>

    <h1>The Punctual Pilgrim</h1>
    <p>
        Once in the digital realm of Graphland, there lived a punctual pilgrim named Dot. Dot's life purpose was to travel across the 2D plane of existence, visiting sacred points of energy, known to the inhabitants as "Coordinodes." These weren't just ordinary points, but locations where the fabric of their universe's source code was the thinnest. Visiting these points in a specific sequence was said to maintain the balance of the entire digital realm.
    </p>
    <p>
        One day, Dot received the coordinates of the next sequence of Coordinodes they had to visit: points[i] = [xi, yi], where 'n' was the total number of nodes for that cycle. The pilgrimage was not just about visiting; it was about the efficiency of the journey, for time rippled strangely across Graphland.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rules for the pilgrimage were peculiar:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Dot could shift vertically or horizontally by one unit or diagonally by sqrt(2) units, with each movement precisely consuming one second.</li>
        <li>The sequence of visiting the Coordinodes was non-negotiable; the array's order was said to be set by the Algorithms of Old.</li>
        <li>Passing through future points was permissible, but you must still visit them at a later stage.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        On this journey, Dot had the coordinates: points = [[1,1], [3,4], [6,1]] <br>
        From [1,1] to [3,4], the quickest path was diagonally to [3,3] (taking sqrt(2)*2 seconds, approximately 2.83, which in Graphland rounded to 3 seconds due to their discrete fabric of time) and then one unit up, requiring one more second. Total time: 4 seconds. <br>
        From [3,4] to [6,1], Dot moved diagonally to [6,3] (3 seconds) and then vertically down two units (2 seconds). Total time: 5 seconds. <br>
        Hence, to maintain the realm's balance, Dot's journey took 9 seconds in total.

    Explanation: <br>
    February in the year 2024 is a leap year, so it has 29 days. <br>
    The 1st of February, 2024, falls on a Thursday (this specific alignment should be calculated, it's not given).

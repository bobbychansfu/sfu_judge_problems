    <h1>Bobland Coins</h1>
    <p>
        The government of Bobland, the newest country, would like you to help write a program for calculating currency. The country has coins in $2, $1, 50¢, 25¢, 10¢, 5¢, and 1¢ denominations,
Given the input $n$, the number of cents, we would like to write a program to calculate the least number of coins that can form $n$. You will output $t$, a single number representing the least number of coins needed.


    </p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        A single integer $n$, the number cents to be made
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        A single integer $t$, representing the least number of Bobland coins that are needed to make $n$ cents. If the user enters a non-integer input, print out "not possible"

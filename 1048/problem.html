    <h1>Dogwarts Academy</h1>
    <p>
        Dogwarts is an open education school of magic for those who want to avoid 
        dealing with the high tuition fees and internal politics of Hogwarts. 
        To make things simple, they have decided to sort students based on four 
        abilities: dark arts, vision, mind reader, and enchantment. 
        All students are labelled with a positive number. The following table describes
        the students abilities based on their student numbers.
        
        <table class="table">
            <tr> <th>student number</th> <th> ability </th> </tr> 
            <tr> <td>divisible by 3</td> <td> dark arts </td> </tr>
            <tr> <td>divisible by 4</td> <td> vision </td> </tr>
            <tr> <td>divisible by 5</td> <td> mind reader </td> </tr>
            <tr> <td>divisible by 7</td> <td> enchantment </td> </tr>
        </table>
        note that you can have students in all four categories or none of the categories. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Write a student curation program that collects students' numbers until a negative number is entered, then reports the number of students in each category.

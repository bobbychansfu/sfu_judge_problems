<h1>Springtime Blossoms</h1>

<p>
    It is the start of Spring in Simon Fraser Valley. 
    New life is everywhere: flowers blossom, critters scuttle about, 
    and baby raccoons are learning their ways to the dining hall. 
    The air is filled with the sweet scent of cherry blossoms and the sound of birds chirping. 
    Unfortunately, as beautiful as this season is, it brings tremendous hardships to many. 
    With summer job postings drying up, finals lurking around the corner and a barely-started assignment due tomorrow,
    you have decided to follow in the footsteps of the legendary goose farmer and abandon the cruel Computer Science for good. 
    Unlike that famous ex-architect, however, you lack the funds for a quaint goose farm. 
    Fortunately, your beloved student society’s garden is in dire need of a caretaker, and honestly that's a decent alternative.
</p>
<p>
    On the first day on the job, your task is to prepare a $1xN$ strip of land to grow $K$ types of plants, each plant uses a $1x1$ square.
    You want to use all of the land, so the plan is to partition the land into $K$ segments that completely cover the strip, one per plant type.
    Unfortunately, the soil is very different from square to square, which will make it difficult
    for the plants to grow properly. The less difference there is in soil quality
    for a particular plant-type, the likelier it is for the group to adapt and grow.
    We define the growth-difficulty of a segment as the difference between the best and worst soil quality in that segment.
    Growth-difficulty of a strip partition is the sum of the difficulties of the K segments fully covering the strip.
    We have no budget for fertilizer this year, so the best you can do is to
    find the optimal way to divide the land.

<h2>Input</h2>
The first line contains two integers $N$ and $K$ (1 ≤ $N$ ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ $K$ ≤ min(50, N)),
the length of the strip and the number of plant types, respectively.
The second line contains N integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N$ (1 ≤ $a_i$ ≤ $10^9$),
the soil quality of each square of land.

<h2>Output</h2>
Output a single integer, the growth-difficulty of the optimal partition.

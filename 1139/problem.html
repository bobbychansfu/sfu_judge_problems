<h1>Springtime Blossoms</h1>

<p>
    It is the start of Spring in Simon Fraser Valley. 
    New life is everywhere: flowers blossom, critters scuttle about, 
    and baby raccoons are learning their ways to the dining hall. 
    The air is filled with the sweet scent of cherry blossoms and the sound of birds chirping. 
    As beautiful as this season is, it comes with hardships for some. 
    With summer job postings drying up and finals lurking around the corner,
    you’ve decided to follow in the footsteps of the legendary goose farmer and leave your Computer Science for good. 
    Unlike that famous ex-architect, however, you lack the funds for a quaint goose farm. 
    Fortunately, your beloved student society’s garden is in dire need of a caretaker, which is basically the next best thing.
</p>
<p>
    On the first day on the job, your task is to prepare a 1xN strip of land to grow K types of plants.
    You want to use all of the land, so you will select K non-overlapping segments that completely cover the strip, one for each plant.
    Unfortunately, the soil is very different from square to square, which makes it difficult
    for plants to succesfully grow. The less difference there is in soil quality,
    for a particular plant-type, the better the plant will grow.
    We define the growth-difficulty of a segment as the difference between the best and worst soil quality in that segment.
    Growth-difficulty of a strip partition is the sum of the difficulties of the K segments fully covering the strip.
    We have no budget for fertilizer this year, so the best you can do is to
    find the optimal way to divide the land. 
</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
The first line contains two integers $N$ and $K$ (1 ≤ $N$ ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ $K$ ≤ min(50, N)),
the length of the strip and the number of plant types, respectively.
The second line contains N integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N$ (1 ≤ $a_i$ ≤ $10^9$),
the soil quality of each square of land.

<h2>Output</h2>
Output a single integer, the growth-difficulty of the optimal partition.

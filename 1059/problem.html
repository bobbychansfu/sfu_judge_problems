    <h1>Jojo's Simple Interest</h1>
    <p>
        Jojo is taking out a loan of $P$ dollars from the bank at an interest rate of $r%$ per year. He had to pay back the loan and all accrued interest after $t$ years.   
        
    </p>
    <p>
        Write a program to help Jojo calculate and print the total amount (principal + interest) Jojo had to pay back after $t$ years.
    </p>
    <p>
        The formula for simple interest is: <br>
        $A = P(1 + rt)$ <br>
        Where,
        $A$ = Total amount of Interest <br>
        $P$ = Principal amount <br>
        $r$ = Rate of interest per year in decimal <br>
        $t$ = Time period in years

    </p>
    <h2> Input</h2>

    <p>
        The values $A$, $P$, $r$, and $t$.  Please note you do not need to prompt the user in this question.
    </p>

    <h2> Output</h2>

    <p>
        The total amount that Jojo needs to pay back rounded to $2$ decimal places.
    </p>

    <h2>Constraints</h2>

    <p>
        $0 \le P \le 100000$ <br>
        $0 \le r \le 20$ <br>
        $0 \le t \le 20$

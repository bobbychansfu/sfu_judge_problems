    <h1>Quirky Queries</h1>
    <p>
        Bob is painting his wooden fence.
        Bob has a long fence, so he grabs a can of paint, starts somewhere
        along the line, and paints wood planks one by one until he runs out of
        paint, moving in a single direction.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, he often does this absent-mindedly,
        and forgets what colour his fence is painted where.
    </p>
    <p>
        Help him keep track!
    </p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        The first line of input will contain two positive integers,
        $n$ and $q$, the number of wooden planks in his fence
        and the number of queries you will be given.
        The wooden planks are numbered from $1$ to $n$, and are
        originally all painted <pre>white</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Then follow $q$ queries, each on their own line<br>
        They either represent that he has painted
        planks $a$ through $b$ (inclusive, $a \leq b$) of his fence with colour <pre>col</pre>:<br>
        <pre>p a b col</pre> (<pre>col</pre> will be 10 characters or fewer)<br>
        A query can also ask what colour plank $i$ is coloured, in which case
        you will print the colour:<br>
        <pre>q i</pre>
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        Output the correct colour for each of the queries of the second type.
        You do not need to output anything for queries of the first type.
    </p>

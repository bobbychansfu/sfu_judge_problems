    <h1>Reversed Fibonacci</h1>
    <p>
        In a small town, there lived a young inventor named Leo. He was obsessed with the concept of sequences. One day, Leo created a remarkable machine, something he called the "Sequence-Reversing Machine." Leo decided to use the famous Fibonacci series, a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. He wanted to show that his machine could reverse this series, displaying the numbers in a backward sequence.

    <p>
        Excitedly, he invited the townspeople to witness his experiment. He set the machine to reverse the first ten terms of the Fibonacci series. The machine hummed and whirred, and to the amazement of the onlookers, it started producing numbers: 34, 21, 13, 8, 5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0. The crowd gasped in wonder. Leo's machine had worked perfectly, displaying the Fibonacci series in reverse!

        Can you reproduce Leo's machine? Write a program that takes a positive integer $n$ as input and outputs the first $n$ numbers of the Fibonacci series in reverse order.

    <h3>Input Format</h3>

    <p>
        A single integer $n$, the first Fibonacci number in the sequence.

    <p>
        The first $n$ Fibonacci numbers in reverse order.
    </p>

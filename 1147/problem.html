    <h1>Cache Chaos</h1>
    <p>
        You're in Area 51, working on a highly classified computer system that processes massive amounts of
        data from an ancient extraterrestrial ROM. You can request to read a certain memory address and the ROM will,
        albeit
        slowly, return the data at that address.
    </p>

    <p>
        To speed things up, the system relies on a cache with $n$ slots to store recently accessed memory addresses and
        associated data. You know that the cache follows an <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#LRU"> LRU (Least Recently Used) </a> eviction
        policy.
    </p>

    <p>
        (For example, let's say the cache has 3 slots and is initially empty, and the following read operations occur in
        sequence:
    <ul>
        <li>READ 1 -- Cache: [1] (1 is added to the cache from ROM)</li>

        <li>READ 2 -- Cache: [1, 2] (2 is added to the cache from ROM)</li>

        <li>READ 3 -- Cache: [1, 2, 3] (3 is added to the cache from ROM, cache is now full)</li>

        <li>READ 1 -- Cache: [2, 3, 1] (1 is already cached and is thus not read from ROM; it becomes most recently used, pushing 2
            to the front)</li>

        <li>READ 4 -- Cache: [3, 1, 4] (Evict 2, add 4 from ROM)</li>
    </ul>

    At this point, the least recently used item is 2, which was evicted to make room for 4. Notice that after each
    read, the cache evicts the least recently used entry to make space for new data if necessary.)
    </p>

    <p>
        However, there's a catch: the cache is unpredictable. Every so often, it malfunctions and corrupts the data
        stored inside (but importantly <em>not</em> the memory addresses). The system still follows its eviction
        rules—the least recently used entries are evicted—but the data is completely scrambled.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now, when a read happens, you might get corrupted data from the cache instead. In the example
        above, if we had a MALFUNCTION after the 'READ 3', then the subsequent 'READ 1' would have returned a corrupted
        value as it was already in the cache before the MALFUNCTION. Further, the cache eviction policy functions as
        normal and 1 still becomes the most recently used as above.
    </p>

    <p>Oh, and because you have to meet certain deadlines to avoid getting fired, you have to read ranges of addresses
        at a time, not just individual addresses. </p>

    <p>
        Your task is to figure out how many times corrupted data is returned from the cache after a series of $k$
        events. Do you have what it takes to keep your job?
    </p>

    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        The first line of the input contains two integers, $n$ (the number of slots in the cache) and $k$ (the number of
        events).
        The following $k$ lines will either be of the form:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>READ $x$ $y$</code> - The memory addresses [$x$, $y$] are read (inclusive). $0 \leq x, y \le 1E9$</li>
        <li><code>MALFUNCTION</code> - The cache is corrupted as described above.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        The output is a single integer representing the number of corrupted reads after processing all events.
    </p>

    <h2>Bounds</h2>
    <p>
        For 40 points, $n \leq 1000$, $k \leq 1000$. At most 1000000 memory locations will be read. <br>
        For 100 points, $n \leq 100000$, $k \leq 1000$. At most 100000k memory locations will be read. <br>
    </p>

    <h3>Sample Input 1</h3>
    <pre>
    3 6
    READ 1 2
    READ 2 3
    MALFUNCTION
    READ 1 3
    READ 6 7
    READ 8 9
    </pre>

    <h3>Sample Output 1</h3>
    <pre>
    3
    </pre>

    <h3>Sample Input 2</h3>
    <pre>
    5 3
    READ 2 6
    MALFUNCTION
    READ 1 5
    </pre>

    <h3>Sample Output 2</h3>
    <pre>
    0
    </pre>

    <p>Due to "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_(computer_science)#Other_uses">cache thrashing</a>", all
        entries are read from ROM.</p>

    <h1>Dallidrums</h1>
    <p>
        Johnny, a curious and enthusiastic 3-year-old boy, has a peculiar interest in numbers. He particularly enjoys numbers that read the same way, both forwards and backwards, which he refers to as "Dallidrums."
        </p>
        <p>
            To help Johnny in his quest for Dallidrums, you have been tasked with finishing the function isDallidrum(s). This function takes an integer as an input and returns a Boolean value, True or False, depending on whether the number reads the same way forwards and backwards.

        </p>
<p>
To complete this task, you can download the provided sample code and write the <code>isDallidrum(s)</code> function; do not change anything else in the code. With your help, Johnny can continue his pursuit of Dallidrums with ease! <br>
<code>isDallidrum(232)</code> returns <code>True</code> <br>
<code>isDallidrum(-232)</code> returns <code>False</code> <br>
<code>isDallidrum(20)</code> returns <code>False</code>

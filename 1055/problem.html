    <h1>King of Productia</h1>
    <p>
        There once was a kingdom called Productia, where there was a king who had a vast collection of jewels, gold, and precious stones. He was obsessed with finding the maximum value of all possible subsets of his collection. He did not know how to calculate it, as some of his resources had negative values that might produce something valuable when combined with other negative-valued resources.    
    </p>
    <p>
        One day, a wise wizard visited the kingdom and proposed the solution to the king's problem was to find the maximum product of his collection by finding the subset of his collection that had the highest product. The wizard showed the king some examples to help him understand the concept.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if the kingdom had the resources [ 4, -8, 0, 8 ], the maximum product of a subset would be 32, which comes from the product of values [ 4, 8 ].
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, if the kingdom had the resources [ -6, 4, -5, 8, -10, 0, 8 ], the maximum product of a subset would be 15360, which comes from the product of values [ -6, 4, 8, -10, 8 ].
    </p>
    <p>
        The king was amazed by the simplicity of the solution. To solve the challenge, the king needs to write a program that reads all the values of his kingdom as the first input line and outputs the maximum product. To help the king, download the starting code provided in this question and write the function <code>findMaxProduct(nums)</code> which receives a list of numbers representing the value of each resource in Productia and returns the maximum product. 
        You may assume that every resource in the kingdom is valued in range [ -1000, 1000 ].
    </p>

    <p>
    To complete this task, you can download the provided sample code and write the <code>findMaxProduct(nums)</code> function. Do not change anything else in the code.  <br>
    <code>findMaxProduct([ -6, 4, -5, 8, -10, 0, 8 ])</code> returns <code>15360</code> <br>
    <code>findMaxProduct([ 4, -8, 0, 8 ])</code> returns <code>32</code>

    </p>
